    <h3>The Meaning of Theology</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Thomas Oden (1931-) - “Theology...is reasoned
        discourse about God gained either by rational
        reflection or by response to God’s self-disclosure
        in history. Christian theology is the orderly
        exposition of Christian teaching. It sets forth
        that understanding of God that is made known in
        Jesus Christ. It seeks to provide a coherent
        reflection on the living God as understood in the
        community whose life is ‘in Christ’.” <b>Positive</b></li>
      <li>Francis Schussler Fiorenza (1941— ) - Theology
        is a fragile discipline in that it is both academic
        and related to faith. As an academic discipline,
        theology shares all the scholarly goals of other
        academic disciplines: it strives for historical
        exactitude, conceptual rigor, systematic consistency,
        and interpretive clarity. In its relation to faith,
        theology… <b>Fragility of the theology</b></li>
      <li>Paul Tillich (1886-1965) - “Theology, as a
        function of the Christian church, must serve
        the needs of the church. A theological system
        is supposed to satisfy two basic needs: the
        statement of truth of the Christian message
        and the interpretation of this truth for every
        new generation. Theology moves back and forth
        between two poles, the eternal truth of its
        foundation and the temporal situation in which
        the eternal truth must be received.” <b>Practical
        so that we may apply it to our lives.</b> </li>
